* What's that ?

It looks like a FTP server and its client.

* It works well ?

I don't have to answer this kind of questions.
But I think so.

* How does it work ?

Type `./configure && gmake all`.
Enjoy.

* Cool. And ?

Once you do the `./configure`, you can play wih the pretty Makefile.
Since you're still here, the test works with `gmake check`.

* Thanks to ?

All the team ! (See the AUTHORS).

* Any greets ?

Bique_a for his ftp server ! Thanks !
And detour_o for his help in debugging the client.

* That's sweet. And ?

`gmake doc` to create a nice pdf file !

* Finally ?

The lie is a cake.
