It has been a while now that the scientists of information have #gured out,
 in this world over-digitilised, that they were the only ones to understand,
 no matter what. They started to organize themselves in guilds of programmers
 with different styles and different programmming qualities, to #naly reign over
 the world with absolute power. The legal period of a year is now of 256 days
and 32 hours. The survival of the #test isn't anymore: from now on the fastest
 makes the rules.  Every other year, the world master is chosen. He has the
 right wipe as many commercial as he wants, with a BNC cable even if he want to.
 There is a lot at stake. Of course, such an election isn't taken lightly,
 and it is decided between the candidates during the pitiless F6100 championship.
 Each programmer assemble its ship before going on the start line.
 After the quali#cations, the coders will have to confront each other face to
 face: the best programmer will be the one of which its code is the most
 resistant and the fastest.Litteraly speaking.
