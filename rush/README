* What's that ?

It looks like a shoot'em up.

* It works well ?

I don't have to answer this kind of questions.
But I think so.

* How does it work ?

Type `./configure && gmake all`.
Enjoy.

* Cool. And ?

Once you do the `./configure`, you can play wih the pretty Makefile.
Since you're still here, the game works with `gmake check`.

* So what ?

Left Control to shoot.
Left Alt to use the bonii.
The arrows to move.
Espace to quit ; Return to retry a level.
11 weapons, 4 bonii, 15 different ships !
Cheats : F12.

* Thanks to ?

All the team ! (See the AUTHORS).

* Any greets ?

The ACUs for the orange juice !

* That's sweet. And ?

`gmake doc` to create a nice pdf file !

* Finally ?

The lie is a cake.
